# üåæ Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
Agriculture is a key sector in when it comes to our country, and predicting crop production can help optimize **resource allocation, yield forecasting, and policy-making**. In this project, I used historical crop production data to build **predictive models** that estimate crop yield based on features like **State, District, Crop, Season, Area, and Year**.

Accurate crop prediction can help in **agriculture planning, resource optimization, and policy-making**.

## üìà Key Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features
- Seasonal and state-wise crop production trends
- Top crops by production
- Actual vs Predicted plots for all models
- XGBoost feature importance chart

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- **XGBoost Regressor** was the best-performing model with an R¬≤ score of **0.945** and the lowest RMSE.
- Regularization (Lasso/Ridge) did not significantly improve results compared to Linear Regression.
- Top 5 crops by production: **Coconut**, **Sugarcane**, **Rice**, **Wheat**, **Potato**.
- Highest production seen in states: **Kerela**, **Tamil Nadu**, **Karnataka**, **Andhara Pradesh**, **West Bemgal**.
-  Seasonal trend shows crops cultivated whole year leads in overall production while Kharif and Rabi come after it.
